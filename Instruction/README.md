Instructions

1. Define an interface named **Vehicle** with the following properties:
   * **make** of type string
   * **model** of type string
   * **year** of type number
   * **start** method which returns void and logs "Engine started" to the console.
2. Implement a class named **Car** that implements the **Vehicle** interface. The **Car** class should have:
   * A constructor that initializes the  **make** ,  **model** , and **year** properties.
   * Implement the **start** method to log "Car engine started" to the console.
3. Create an instance of the **Car** class and initialize it with some values for  **make** ,  **model** , and  **year** .
4. Call the **start** method on the instance of the **Car** class to verify that it logs the appropriate message to the console.
5. Finally, compile your TypeScript code into JavaScript and run it to ensure everything works as expected.
